Strategy and Identity. Time and Movement. Information and Systems. and Experience and Environment. Later in the course- these lead to communities of practice- based on themes and issues.Co-design your curriculum: In your final year of study- you will directly influence the curriculum by developing subjects for exploration and experimentation.Wide-ranging and specialist practice: The course structure allows you to balance the relationship between breadth and specialism.Live projects: You can elect to tackle live briefs engaging local government- non-profits and companies. Recently- this has included work with organisations such as the BBC- the British Library- Lightvert- Louis Jadot- Mother- NHS Camden Clinical Commissioning Group- Tezenis and Transport for London.Graphic communication design practice is changing. The wide availability of design software and digital production tools has resulted in a re-evaluation of what the trained- skilled designer can offer. In response- design professions have developed more sophisticated consultancy models. Design thinking- marketing- branding and strategy are now offered as a central part of their services. Graphic communication design is also increasingly carried out in a diverse range of contexts. These range from large commercial and governmental departments to independent practitioners and small enterprises.  BA Graphic Communication Design at Central Saint Martins takes into account this current industry climate. It explores graphic communication design as an expanded practice. It will provide you with a solid grounding in the discipline's core languages- contexts and applications- while also encouraging you to test and stretch its boundaries. The course structure is devised to support three types of practitioner: The inter-disciplinary designer or polymath who wants to stay broad-based The hybrid designer who works across a targeted combination of areas The specialist who has more specific discipline focus The course curriculum places emphasis on five core processes: typography- digital- context- image and print. These are taught throughout the course and will provide a foundation for your studio work and theoretical studies. Led by staff specialists- you will also be introduced to areas such as photography- printmaking and bookbinding.  The course structure enables student mobility across five platforms and communities of practice. The platforms are an investigation into the multiple disciplines of graphic communication design. They are formulated in correspondence to areas of contemporary design practice. The platforms give focus to the intentions and values of your practice. They also offer points of departure as you develop your identity within a community of practice in Stages 2 and 3.

Graphic Communication Design pursues a direct and in-depth connection between the applied arts tradition of graphic design and a critical and creative approach to communication. As a subject of study- graphic communication design cultivates a considered stance towards visual and other media. This stance is activated as an approach to challenging and reconfiguring culture. The goal of this course is to engage the tools of graphic design in experimentation with the basic forms by which knowledge is constituted and mobilised.

During this MA we work with you to transform your practice as a critical and social undertaking.By challenging the role and norms of traditional design towards an emerging type of ‘advanced design’- unshackled from the history of specialisms and entrenched methods- you will become part of a community of practice. You will be encouraged to actively contribute to a deep understanding of how design is set to address and affect change within contemporary society.Whatever your background or previous degree we expect you to examine your own practice.

Designers have the power to affect change through their work- influencing everyday life and shaping behaviours from the micro to the macro level.Bachelor students at DAE are provided with space- support and guidance to explore their relationship with design- as well as its potential as a tool for positive action in a world that is in constant flux. DAE nurtures independent thinking and encourages students to engage deeply with themselves and with their environment- to be curious and to question their assumptions- and to interrogate systems of power- of knowledge and of production.Learning through making is a central concept at DAE. There is a strong focus on ‘doing’- whether it is experimenting with manufacturing- developing a stream of research or collaborating with fellow students to test solutions and explore problems. The schools’ workshops play a key part in the BA programme- with eight spaces dedicated to different materials. For more technical work- the school has fostered partnerships with specialist centres for production- including the Textile Museum in Tilburg- Atelier.nl- the EKWC (the European ceramic Work Centre) in Den Bosch and Bruns (a model-making company) in Bergeijk.A supportive- safe learning environment is key to both personal and professional development. But flexibility- realism and agility are also increasingly important within all forms of education. The realities of the world around us – from pandemics to the climate crisis – demand new approaches.In 2020- the school overhauled its educational structure- reshaping the BA department to better respond to the needs of its students and the increasing pace of change in the wider world. This included the introduction of a new structure- with eight studios- each reflecting a different perspective and position but united in a belief in design as an agent for positive change and a desire to contribute to creating a better future.

Designers have the power to affect change through their work- influencing everyday life and shaping behaviours from the micro to the macro level.Bachelor students at DAE are provided with space- support and guidance to explore their relationship with design- as well as its potential as a tool for positive action in a world that is in constant flux. DAE nurtures independent thinking and encourages students to engage deeply with themselves and with their environment- to be curious and to question their assumptions- and to interrogate systems of power- of knowledge and of production.Learning through making is a central concept at DAE.

Students learn to create new approaches and expressions by communicating in visual and graphic terms- basing their work on an in-depth understanding of artistic and aesthetic techniques- and design methods and history. In the undergraduate Visual Design programme we apply basic- classic design skills and methods to create graphic- visual and interactive products and productions. Students work intensively on innovative design solutions in the fields of print- game- digital- interaction and experience design.\t01123\t\t\t\t1\nThe Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (KADK)\tDenmark\tCopenhagen\t55.6822818\t12.604374930754751\t21\tDesign\tGraphic Communication Design\tYES\thttps://royaldanishacademy.com/programme/graphic-communication-design/om-programmet\tEN\tPOST\tThe programme provides a broad understanding of visual communication within analogue and digital media. It does this by preparing you to take a leading role in addressing and affecting changes in contemporary society by identifying- exploring and solving complex issues through applying design. During your studies- you will engage with a number of disciplines such as visualization- form giving- Design research- experimentation and reflections on various design disciplines. You will learn to adopt a critical approach- questioning existing standards and work with new forms of contexts- formats and collaborations. Students will attend wide themes within society through open research agendas and iterative experimental processes involving the people and environments that the design addresses. These projects open up opportunities for you to work individually or collectively with external partners in a critical exploration of design outcomes.By combining elements of the applied arts tradition within graphic design with a critical and experimental approach- you will have the opportunity to deepen and expand your competencies in areas  like graphic design- visual identity- type design- information design- image production and new areas such as strategic design- service design- design thinking and design research.The level of self-initiation will gradually increase throughout the four semesters.1st semester: Technology and PractiseThe semester focuses on developing the students’ knowledge- skills and competencies within typography- visualization and Design research . The semester projects on VR/AR/AI- type design- art direction and creative codingFollowed by projects on exploring approaches for creating visual universes. The student will be challenged to critically exploring the impact visual universes can have on our perception of the world. In the final project of the semester- the students will work within the field of information design- with external partners on a larger complex theme within society. To sort out and satisfy the information needs of the intended recipients the students will explore various user or paticipatory centered design approaches and work towards clear and efficient data visualizations- information graphics or other types of visualizations.  2nd semester: Concept and MediaThe semester starts out with a project related to investigation. Followed by a workshop course in moving images. The semesters’ main course in a project concerning identity- such as visual identity- artistic identity or cultural identity. During this project- the students will be introduced to a range of different topics and approaches.- such as service design- codesign- digital prototyping- UX- design and branded spaces. In the last part of the semester- the student will take on a self-formulated project. In parallel with the projects there will be a study group for reading and discussing relevant literature. The student is expected to participate and contribute to the study group.  3rd semester: Dialogue with Design MattersAfter an initial course in wayfinding the students begin the theoretical assignment which concerns an issue pertaining to visual communication design matters. The outcome is presented both in writing and as a verbal presentation for the class. Based on the thesis topic- the students will work with dissemination of the required knowledge- this could be through an online format- a physical exhibition- a book or something else. The final assignment of the semester is a preliminary to the graduation project.

During your studies- you will engage with a number of disciplines such as visualization- form giving- Design research- experimentation and reflections on various design disciplines. You will learn to adopt a critical approach- questioning existing standards and work with new forms of contexts- formats and collaborations. Students will attend wide themes within society through open research agendas and iterative experimental processes involving the people and environments that the design addresses. These projects open up opportunities for you to work individually or collectively with external partners in a critical exploration of design outcomes.By combining elements of the applied arts tradition within graphic design with a critical and experimental approach- you will have the opportunity to deepen and expand your competencies in areas  like graphic design- visual identity- type design- information design- image production and new areas such as strategic design- service design- design thinking and design research.The level of self-initiation will gradually increase throughout the four semesters.1st semester: Technology and PractiseThe semester focuses on developing the students’ knowledge- skills and competencies within typography- visualization and Design research . The semester projects on VR/AR/AI- type design- art direction and creative codingFollowed by projects on exploring approaches for creating visual universes. The student will be challenged to critically exploring the impact visual universes can have on our perception of the world. In the final project of the semester- the students will work within the field of information design- with external partners on a larger complex theme within society. To sort out and satisfy the information needs of the intended recipients the students will explore various user or paticipatory centered design approaches and work towards clear and efficient data visualizations- information graphics or other types of visualizations.  2nd semester: Concept and MediaThe semester starts out with a project related to investigation. Followed by a workshop course in moving images. The semesters’ main course in a project concerning identity- such as visual identity- artistic identity or cultural identity. During this project- the students will be introduced to a range of different topics and approaches.- such as service design- codesign- digital prototyping- UX- design and branded spaces. In the last part of the semester- the student will take on a self-formulated project. In parallel with the projects there will be a study group for reading and discussing relevant literature. The student is expected to participate and contribute to the study group.  3rd semester: Dialogue with Design MattersAfter an initial course in wayfinding the students begin the theoretical assignment which concerns an issue pertaining to visual communication design matters. The outcome is presented both in writing and as a verbal presentation for the class. Based on the thesis topic- the students will work with dissemination of the required knowledge- this could be through an online format- a physical exhibition- a book or something else.

Strategy and Identity. Time and Movement. Information and Systems. and Experience and Environment. Later in the course- these lead to communities of practice- based on themes and issues.Co-design your curriculum: In your final year of study- you will directly influence the curriculum by developing subjects for exploration and experimentation.Wide-ranging and specialist practice: The course structure allows you to balance the relationship between breadth and specialism.Live projects: You can elect to tackle live briefs engaging local government- non-profits and companies. Recently- this has included work with organisations such as the BBC- the British Library- Lightvert- Louis Jadot- Mother- NHS Camden Clinical Commissioning Group- Tezenis and Transport for London.Graphic communication design practice is changing. The wide availability of design software and digital production tools has resulted in a re-evaluation of what the trained- skilled designer can offer. In response- design professions have developed more sophisticated consultancy models. Design thinking- marketing- branding and strategy are now offered as a central part of their services. Graphic communication design is also increasingly carried out in a diverse range of contexts. These range from large commercial and governmental departments to independent practitioners and small enterprises.  BA Graphic Communication Design at Central Saint Martins takes into account this current industry climate. It explores graphic communication design as an expanded practice. It will provide you with a solid grounding in the discipline's core languages- contexts and applications- while also encouraging you to test and stretch its boundaries. The course structure is devised to support three types of practitioner: The inter-disciplinary designer or polymath who wants to stay broad-based The hybrid designer who works across a targeted combination of areas The specialist who has more specific discipline focus The course curriculum places emphasis on five core processes: typography- digital- context- image and print. These are taught throughout the course and will provide a foundation for your studio work and theoretical studies. Led by staff specialists- you will also be introduced to areas such as photography- printmaking and bookbinding.  The course structure enables student mobility across five platforms and communities of practice. The platforms are an investigation into the multiple disciplines of graphic communication design. They are formulated in correspondence to areas of contemporary design practice. The platforms give focus to the intentions and values of your practice. They also offer points of departure as you develop your identity within a community of practice in Stages 2 and 3.

This meant that I was well equipped to find work at a studio- and become an active member of London's design community.My design education began during my first conversation with (the course leader) Tony Pritchard whilst applying to the Postgraduate Certificate and it continues to this very day”.Tom Hornby – Freelance Designer- Pentagram- formerly Senior designer- SEA Design“This course took me from design zero to creative hero.

The discipline of Interaction Design has emerged to ensure the delivery of these technologies enhances all aspects of modern society. Interaction Design at The Glasgow School of Art focuses on people- rather than technology. This Masters programme looks to tackle real-life problems by improving interaction and communication between stakeholders using a variety of methods.The programme- taught at the school’s campus in the Scottish Highlands- promotes a hands-on approach to interaction design. Through live projects with an emphasis on collaborative working- you will develop an understanding of Interaction Design in complex environments and learn to analyse behaviours that inform the design process.You will also have the opportunity to engage with peers from international schools as part of the annual Winter School held at the campus in Forres. This seasonal event brings together students and faculty from leading institutions around the world for a two-week programme of lectures- workshops and networking opportunities that offers an insight into what a career in design as a global activity looks like.Opportunities enabled by contemporary technologies are examined and incorporated into a programme that adopts a holistic approach to interaction design.

DAE nurtures independent thinking and encourages students to engage deeply with themselves and with their environment- to be curious and to question their assumptions- and to interrogate systems of power- of knowledge and of production.Learning through making is a central concept at DAE. There is a strong focus on ‘doing’- whether it is experimenting with manufacturing- developing a stream of research or collaborating with fellow students to test solutions and explore problems. The schools’ workshops play a key part in the BA programme- with eight spaces dedicated to different materials. For more technical work- the school has fostered partnerships with specialist centres for production- including the Textile Museum in Tilburg- Atelier.nl- the EKWC (the European ceramic Work Centre) in Den Bosch and Bruns (a model-making company) in Bergeijk.A supportive- safe learning environment is key to both personal and professional development. But flexibility- realism and agility are also increasingly important within all forms of education. The realities of the world around us – from pandemics to the climate crisis – demand new approaches.In 2020- the school overhauled its educational structure- reshaping the BA department to better respond to the needs of its students and the increasing pace of change in the wider world. This included the introduction of a new structure- with eight studios- each reflecting a different perspective and position but united in a belief in design as an agent for positive change and a desire to contribute to creating a better future. Students can switch between different studios during their studies- providing new opportunities for exploration- experimentation and research as their interests change.","01065","THE MORNING

You will learn to adopt a critical approach- questioning existing standards and work with new forms of contexts- formats and collaborations. Students will attend wide themes within society through open research agendas and iterative experimental processes involving the people and environments that the design addresses. These projects open up opportunities for you to work individually or collectively with external partners in a critical exploration of design outcomes.By combining elements of the applied arts tradition within graphic design with a critical and experimental approach- you will have the opportunity to deepen and expand your competencies in areas  like graphic design- visual identity- type design- information design- image production and new areas such as strategic design- service design- design thinking and design research.The level of self-initiation will gradually increase throughout the four semesters.1st semester: Technology and PractiseThe semester focuses on developing the students’ knowledge- skills and competencies within typography- visualization and Design research . The semester projects on VR/AR/AI- type design- art direction and creative codingFollowed by projects on exploring approaches for creating visual universes. The student will be challenged to critically exploring the impact visual universes can have on our perception of the world. In the final project of the semester- the students will work within the field of information design- with external partners on a larger complex theme within society. To sort out and satisfy the information needs of the intended recipients the students will explore various user or paticipatory centered design approaches and work towards clear and efficient data visualizations- information graphics or other types of visualizations.  2nd semester: Concept and MediaThe semester starts out with a project related to investigation. Followed by a workshop course in moving images. The semesters’ main course in a project concerning identity- such as visual identity- artistic identity or cultural identity. During this project- the students will be introduced to a range of different topics and approaches.- such as service design- codesign- digital prototyping- UX- design and branded spaces. In the last part of the semester- the student will take on a self-formulated project. In parallel with the projects there will be a study group for reading and discussing relevant literature.

During your studies- you will engage with a number of disciplines such as visualization- form giving- Design research- experimentation and reflections on various design disciplines. You will learn to adopt a critical approach- questioning existing standards and work with new forms of contexts- formats and collaborations. Students will attend wide themes within society through open research agendas and iterative experimental processes involving the people and environments that the design addresses. These projects open up opportunities for you to work individually or collectively with external partners in a critical exploration of design outcomes.By combining elements of the applied arts tradition within graphic design with a critical and experimental approach- you will have the opportunity to deepen and expand your competencies in areas  like graphic design- visual identity- type design- information design- image production and new areas such as strategic design- service design- design thinking and design research.The level of self-initiation will gradually increase throughout the four semesters.1st semester: Technology and PractiseThe semester focuses on developing the students’ knowledge- skills and competencies within typography- visualization and Design research . The semester projects on VR/AR/AI- type design- art direction and creative codingFollowed by projects on exploring approaches for creating visual universes. The student will be challenged to critically exploring the impact visual universes can have on our perception of the world. In the final project of the semester- the students will work within the field of information design- with external partners on a larger complex theme within society. To sort out and satisfy the information needs of the intended recipients the students will explore various user or paticipatory centered design approaches and work towards clear and efficient data visualizations- information graphics or other types of visualizations.  2nd semester: Concept and MediaThe semester starts out with a project related to investigation. Followed by a workshop course in moving images. The semesters’ main course in a project concerning identity- such as visual identity- artistic identity or cultural identity. During this project- the students will be introduced to a range of different topics and approaches.- such as service design- codesign- digital prototyping- UX- design and branded spaces. In the last part of the semester- the student will take on a self-formulated project. In parallel with the projects there will be a study group for reading and discussing relevant literature. The student is expected to participate and contribute to the study group.  3rd semester: Dialogue with Design MattersAfter an initial course in wayfinding the students begin the theoretical assignment which concerns an issue pertaining to visual communication design matters. The outcome is presented both in writing and as a verbal presentation for the class. Based on the thesis topic- the students will work with dissemination of the required knowledge- this could be through an online format- a physical exhibition- a book or something else.
