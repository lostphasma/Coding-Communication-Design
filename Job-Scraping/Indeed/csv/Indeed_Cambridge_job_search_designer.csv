To get the most from our products, users first have to understand what they’re capable of. Your content will need to be engaging, interactive and unambiguous. You’ll also have the opportunity to contribute to API and UX design.
Who’s the ideal candidate?
You’ll have experience working in a development team and delivering documentation for technical users. You’ll enjoy understanding complex technical concepts and finding ways to make them accessible at various levels.
This role can be done on a full-time or part-time basis.
Requirements:
You’ll have:
Excellent written and verbal communication skills (of course)
Communicating complex ideas in an easy to understand manner to a range of target audiences
The ability (and desire) to learn new technologies
