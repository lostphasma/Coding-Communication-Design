#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Drive collaboration with marketing, brand, strategy, and editorial teams to align from the design purpose to the execution roadmap
Collaboratively create digital product concepts that push the bar for quality and excellence in each field/industry
Craft a foundation for Design System, typography, iconography, colour, grid, and design components
Frame a vision for art direction, photography, and illustration to reinforce product/service vision
Craft brand identities and brand collateral
Support the team with guidance for visual expression

HIGH-LEVEL QUALIFICATIONS:

ABOUT US:
Braintrust (usebraintrust.com) is a user-controlled talent network, where you keep 100% of what you earn and actually get to own the platform. We've been onboarding some big clients and specifically need a Sr. Production Designer for Design System for our client.

ABOUT OUR CLIENT: Our client's envision a world where the experience of selling or buying a home is simple and pleasant for everyone. Founded in 2012, our client provides an end-to-end platform that empowers residential real estate agents to deliver exceptional service to their seller and buyer clients, all in service of our mission to help everyone find their place in the world.

THE OPPORTUNITY:
We are looking for a Senior Production Designer to support crafting web and mobile components that include the full rigor of design around macro- and micro-UI interactions and states. The ideal candidate will be fluent in working with Figma, and have a strong foundation in mobile and responsive design. Our component libraries and patterns have to support an array of needs around productivity, search, and communication. Our design systems play an essential role supporting the success of our development teams to think big, be solutions driven, and move fast to ensure our customers are always prepared and productive.

Our client seeks to solve highly complex problems through an end-to-end platform solution that measurably improves business outcomes for our agent customer. Because our model disrupts existing processes that are often disconnected and inefficient (and sometimes still being executed via analog solutions), our experiences need to clearly demonstrate value, lower the barrier to entry, and be dead simple to use. This is a great opportunity for product designers who are strong system thinkers, excited about the ways that technology can take on the heavy lifting of day to day work, and have a demonstrated track record of delivering simple, intuitive customer experiences.

WHAT YOU’LL DO:
Designers lead the full lifecycle of their designs across all platforms, collaborate with product managers on strategy, participate in research to test and validate designs, and consult with engineering to make everything come to life.
Own the iterative design process from research/discovery to concept to final delivery
Create key artifacts and components for our design system, including
Listing and platform status badges
Web and mobile card variants and motion patterns; drag and drop pattern
Accessible map pin stages across multiple map views (default, flood zones, satellite)
Create scalable components and patterns that work across multiple work surfaces and platforms and work with complex use-cases and requirements.
Meaningfully collaborate with Design System team (composed of designers and front-end/mobile engineers)
Pair with engineers to realize your designs on all platforms (web, iOS, Android).
Be constantly on the lookout for best practices, design patterns and anti-patterns, throughout various industries and platforms.
Participate in sprint planning discussions.
Be a key player on a small but mighty team making a huge impact

ABOUT THE HIRING PROCESS:
Qualified candidates will be invited to do a screening interview with the Braintrust staff. We will answer your questions about the project, and our platform. If we determine it is the right fit for both parties, we'll invite you to join the platform and create a profile to apply directly for this project.
C2C Candidates: This role is not available to C2C candidates working with an agency. If you are a professional contractor who has created an LLC/corp around their consulting practice, this is well aligned with Braintrust and we’d welcome your application.
Braintrust values the multitude of talents and perspectives that a diverse workforce brings. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or protected veteran status.

We are designing a holistic product and service solution. You will work across design fields, including brand, UX and interaction, service, and industrial design.

WHAT YOU WILL LOVE ABOUT US
We care about culture and constantly tend to it. At Seven:
Learning is valued
No one is above another
We teach each other things
Work that stays at work

We all have interests and passions outside of our 9-5. We make sure you have the time and space to go and do them.

Generous health benefits
Medical with HSA and FSA options, dental and vision - we cover more plans than most places (probably a good thing as a health company)
Prepare for the future - 401k

ONE MORE THING...
Your gender, your race, your religion, your skin color, who you love, or who you know, does not make a difference here. Be good at what you do, be kind to each other and be yourself. If you have a problem with this, we are not the place for you.

55,Visual Designer,"San Francisco, CA",Not shown,Mercury,3.7,4 days ago,"About the team
The Evernote Design team is the creative collective responsible for producing a seamless and delightful user experience, from sign-up to the thousandth note. We work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to define and deliver product experiences that enhance people's lives at work and at play.

Why growth design is special
Growth is an exciting and emergent field. We'd be lying if we said we fully understood it ourselves… but then again, that is just the thing. To be truly successful at it, you have to be willing to admit you don't know. You have to want to keep learning. Growth experimentation is an alchemical process that calls upon art, psychology, reason, the scientific method, and on some occasions a little luck and magic doesn't hurt either. Relentless creativity and cheerful optimism will take you far. One of our designers wrote a great post about it. Give it a read! The Product Designer's Guide to Growth.

What you'll do
As a Product Designer on the Growth Experiments team, you will work with an incredible group of designers, developers, product managers, and data analysts to identify and execute on a wide range of strategic tactics for getting people more engaged with Evernote. You will craft memorable onboarding experiences, optimize monetization flows, and reimagine the UX of pivotal moments in a customer's journey. Together, we will design tons of growth experiments, and we will move numbers.
Be the voice in the room that always puts the user first—constantly looking for ways to accomplish business objectives through experiences that are delightful and meaningful for real people.
Carry ideas from inception through development and multiple rounds of iteration.
Define and execute A/B tests and multivariate experiment designs, flowcharts, prototypes, UI mockups, technical specs, and production assets.
Translate quantitative data and qualitative insights into creative ideas and informed design decisions.
Drive a high level of visual fidelity across products.
Provide and solicit actionable feedback to move designs forward.
Balance a large volume of design initiatives at high velocity and keep your head straight.
Learn. All the time, every day.
What you've done
Experience designing engaging user experiences for both web and native apps.
Proficiency in user-centered design thinking methodologies and rapid iterative experimentation.
Experience with prototype designs in lo- and hi-fidelity, and know when to do which.
A proven track-record for shipping high quality experiences.
2+ years of relevant product experience.
B.A., B.S. or M.A. in design, HCI, or equivalent experience.
Who you are
Able to learn quickly and recognize on a deep level that everything is changeable and everything can be better (possess a growth mindset)
Able to formulate and present an evidence-based point of view that supports your design decisions.
Unafraid to debate and share your point of view while being receptive to others.
Eager to take initiative and ownership of projects.
Highly visual with passion for UI design and typography.
A ninja. We're not just being cute here. To succeed in this role you must be quick, clever, resourceful, nimble, focused, and above all, 100% committed to the mission.

We are committed to an inclusive and diverse Evernote. We believe that different perspectives lead to better ideas, and better ideas allow us to better understand the needs and interests of our diverse, global Evernote Community. We welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, abilities and perspectives and are an equal opportunity employer.

In 1954, in Columbus, Indiana, Eero Saarinen designed a bank with glass walls, no offices, and a completely open floor plan. It was surrounded by trees; the furniture was made by Herman Miller; the lobby flooring was thick, rustic brick. The bank was built with transparency and community at its core.
Since 1954, a lot of things have happened — Saarinen’s bank branch is now a conference center, people increasingly live on the internet, and it’s hard to think of a single bank that still applies design thinking to their product.
Mercury is building a bank for startups. We believe building a bank in 2021 revolves around thoughtful design, and we’re looking to add a visual designer to our team to help.
You will:
Create a unified visual language for Mercury across mediums, including marketing pages, web and mobile apps, emails, print, online ads, billboards, and marketing ephemera
Create graphics for digital formats, like our website, and physical objects, like our debit cards, tote bags, and tea packages
Use visual design to express our values and product philosophy
Work on projects with a wide scope, from minute interactions and animations to whole pages of the website
Take prosaic moments and turn them into something special with elegant design
You should:
Have a certain wild visual flair
Think about design systems, not just individual pages or embellishments
Have experience designing visuals for web, mobile, and print
Have an interest in learning about and working on product design
Understand how to create clean layouts with a strong visual structure and hierarchy
Believe in the beauty of utility and function
Be able to tell complex stories with simple visuals
Pull from a wide range of aesthetic references and be able to synthesize them into a single cohesive style
Understand Mercury’s brand, voice, and aesthetic, and how they can be expressed through your design
Be able to articulate and debate the reasoning behind your design decisions
Have a love for language

Challenge.
We’re shaking up one of the least innovative, most powerful industries around, eliminating pain points faced by every startup, and filling a crucial missing piece in the tech ecosystem.
Building a bank from the ground up is a big project; the product is complex and cannot break, there are stringent regulations, and we’ll have to outcompete some of the largest, most entrenched corporations in the world. But overcoming these challenges means we’ll have built something that lasts.
Impact.
Working on a lean, self-motivated team means autonomy, broad experience across projects, and seeing your contributions directly shape the product and impact users.
You’ll work on pieces of the product where you’ll make foundational decisions; starting from scratch requires careful thought, and your design choices will serve as the bedrock of future development.
Quality.
Design is a fundamental differentiator between us and the rest of the market, so we invest heavily in making a quality product and will give you the resources to build something beautiful.
We try to think hard about how to make features that users love; see our blog post on our date picker for an example. Our goal is to be proud of what we’ve crafted.
