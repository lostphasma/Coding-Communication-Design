Roku is changing how the world watches TV
Roku is the #1 TV streaming platform in the U.S., and we've set our sights on powering every television in the world. Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.

From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world, while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.

About the role
Roku is looking for an experienced Interaction Designer who can craft easy-to-use experiences for the web-based operational tools that power our content business. You'll be working with Product Management, Engineering, UX Research, and other team members to define and design new features that make content on the Roku platform simple to access, easy to understand, and a joy to watch. You will also work with other UX designers to help define design systems for all of Roku's operational tools so that they look and work consistently while providing a consumer-grade user experience.

Roku has become famous for making sure each feature and product is as perfect as it can be – just look at our remote control or user interface – while still pushing the boundaries of what it means to watch TV. Outstanding user experiences come from people who have the vision to see the big picture while maintaining an incredible attention to detail - partnering with Product Management and internalizing short-term and long-term business goals; understanding Engineering capabilities and constraints; and applying your own user-centered design skills and expertise to bring the best possible experience to the users of these critical operational tools.

Great candidates are comfortable with ambiguity, though that isn't code for ""sloppy."" Even when you aren't sure, you should move forward precisely and quickly knowing that action creates its own certainty. And because everyone here is empowered, your performance at Roku tends to come from getting others to embrace your idea. It's the most collaborative people who can drop their ego to create the win-win of success for our customers.

What you'll be doing
Partner with product managers, engineers, and cross-functional stakeholders to understand requirements and provide creative, thoughtful solutions
Explore a variety of design directions, analyzing the pros and cons of each
Communicate the user experience at various stages of the design process with wireframes, flow diagrams, storyboards, mockups, specs, and/or lightweight prototypes
Iterate designs based on user feedback and business needs

10+ years of relevant industry experience as an interaction designer

Excellent problem-solving skills and relentless attention to detail
Strong project management skills with the ability to define, plan, and lead projects forward
Proficiency in UX Design tools such as Sketch (or similar) to create user interfaces
Portfolio highlighting multiple projects demonstrating user-centered design solutions with measurable outcomes (include online portfolio link with resume)
Master's degree in Design, Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, or a related field
Preferred Qualifications
Skills in communicating and influencing product strategy
Familiarity with technical constraints and limitations as they apply to designing for TV

Our unique culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
Hear from our UX leadership
Making the complex easy to use is what we work on every day. If that sounds like where you'd like to spend your time, we have a few other similar UX/UI roles at Roku at the moment.

Prototyping and design iteration. You must be a maker at heart. Physical prototyping is our bread and butter, a daily activity that brings life to our ideas, informs design decisions, and drives our process forward. We like to get our hands dirty, move quickly, and iterate often. Familiarity with sewing, fabrics, and soft goods is a must.
Product testing. We hold weekly product testing sessions with kids, and the feedback we glean from these sessions deeply impacts our product direction. We love ‘em, and hope that you do too!
Material sourcing and sampling. As awesome as our ideas may be, the execution of these ideas is just as important. We work closely with our Sourcing and Operations teams, as well as our manufacturers to ensure that our products meet the highest quality standards.
Editorial. A project is only as good as its instructions. We work closely with our editorial team to create compelling and clear instructions sets, as well as magazine content and DIY activities.

Experience: 2-5 years+ designing physical products. Experience with all aspects of the product development process, from conception through to a finished product. You are passionate about the design process and tirelessly pursue excellence in all aspects.
Strong physical prototyping skills. You’re a maker at heart and love getting creative with your hands. You’re always bursting with crafty new ideas and can whip them up in a jiffy. Taking an idea from your head to a physical prototype and then rapidly iterating comes naturally.
Effective problem solver, with a hands-on “get things done” mentality. You are eager and able to solve challenges and tackle opportunities, identify potential issues and hurdles, and develop ways to get around them. You can adapt quickly to figure out innovative ways to get things done.
Time management skills and ability to multitask. We move fast. Effective prioritization and organization to stay positive and proactive in an ambiguous environment is a must. We always have several projects on the burner, and learning to parse and prioritize is essential.
Detail & process-oriented. We move quickly, but we bring care and thoughtfulness to everything we do. We care deeply about the details, and strive for excellence in every aspect of the product development process.
Collaboration & communication skills. We work closely with our Operations, Sourcing, Editorial, and Marketing teams. You have exceptional communication skills that allow fluid cross-functional team discussions, projects, and collaborations. A true team player.
Always learning. As a growing startup we’re always faced with new and exciting challenges. We enthusiastically own our many hats, and dive into the unknown. We love to learn, grow, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it).

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA). We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Roku is changing how the world watches TV
Roku is the #1 TV streaming platform in the U.S., and we've set our sights on powering every television in the world. Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.

From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world, while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.

About the role
Roku is looking for an experienced Interaction Designer who can craft easy-to-use experiences for the web-based operational tools that power our content business. You'll be working with Product Management, Engineering, UX Research, and other team members to define and design new features that make content on the Roku platform simple to access, easy to understand, and a joy to watch. You will also work with other UX designers to help define design systems for all of Roku's operational tools so that they look and work consistently while providing a consumer-grade user experience.

Roku has become famous for making sure each feature and product is as perfect as it can be – just look at our remote control or user interface – while still pushing the boundaries of what it means to watch TV. Outstanding user experiences come from people who have the vision to see the big picture while maintaining an incredible attention to detail - partnering with Product Management and internalizing short-term and long-term business goals; understanding Engineering capabilities and constraints; and applying your own user-centered design skills and expertise to bring the best possible experience to the users of these critical operational tools.

Great candidates are comfortable with ambiguity, though that isn't code for ""sloppy."" Even when you aren't sure, you should move forward precisely and quickly knowing that action creates its own certainty. And because everyone here is empowered, your performance at Roku tends to come from getting others to embrace your idea. It's the most collaborative people who can drop their ego to create the win-win of success for our customers.

What you'll be doing
Partner with product managers, engineers, and cross-functional stakeholders to understand requirements and provide creative, thoughtful solutions
Explore a variety of design directions, analyzing the pros and cons of each
Communicate the user experience at various stages of the design process with wireframes, flow diagrams, storyboards, mockups, specs, and/or lightweight prototypes
Iterate designs based on user feedback and business needs
We're excited if you have
5+ years of relevant industry experience as an interaction designer
Experience collaborating with teams of designers, researchers, product managers, and engineers throughout the design process and creating artifacts to document the design and user experience
Excellent communication, presentation, and interpersonal skills
Excellent problem-solving skills and relentless attention to detail
Proficiency in UX Design tools such as Sketch (or similar) to create user interfaces
Portfolio highlighting multiple projects demonstrating user-centered design (include online portfolio link with resume)
Relevant Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD in areas such as Human Factors, HCI, Cognitive Science, Psychology, etc.
Our unique culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.
Hear from our UX leadership
Making the complex easy to use is what we work on every day. If that sounds like where you'd like to spend your time, we have a few other similar UX/UI roles at Roku at the moment.
