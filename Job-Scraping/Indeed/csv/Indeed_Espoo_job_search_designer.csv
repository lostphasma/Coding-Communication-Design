Looking for the next adventure in your career? You are in the right place! We are always happy to get to know people who love learning and have their heart in the right place.
Let’s figure out if we fit together. Read on to find out more about your future role.
Your tasks will consist of project work in one of our cutting-edge development projects. You will be working alongside an experienced cross disciplinary team to learn the secrets of modern software consulting and machine learning. The ultimate goal is to define and complete a concrete task within a 3-4 month period, which will then be concluded by writing a full Master’s thesis.
Your thesis topic will be in one of the following areas:
Case 1 - Better flow of work with data
(joint project with a client)
How can we better understand with data how things are really going in the frontline?
How can we spot deviations and red flags in schedule by utilising different data sources, such as changes in documents?
Is the energy and focus of management on the right things based on the digital footprint from different systems?
Case 2 - Consolidating market knowledge: What is happening outside Futurice?
How can we use data to understand our clients better?
What is happening outside the Futurice? How consolidating data can support our strategy and help our marketing and sales to become more opinionated?
What kind of data sources can we utilise? What data sources are available?
How can we improve our work by consolidating data from current and new tools?
There are two ways to simplify these massive tasks. Either find existing tools & toolsets to achieve or, in case no ready-made tools available, narrow the scope. For us the most important is to implement some use case end to end => from data to business processes. The more we can use readily existing tools, the broader the scope.
Don’t worry, we don’t expect you to know everything beforehand. You will be mentored by both a data scientist and a business designer to maximize your learning and growth and to ensure you get the most out of your Futurice experience. The process will not only involve applying technical skills, but also requires you to apply intrapreneurial skills in recognizing and defining clear business needs. If you’re up for it, there may be a possibility to continue your career at Futurice after the thesis.
Send your application by 28th of March at the latest, the earliest starting date will be in the middle of April.
About You
Here’s a little checklist to help you figure out if we are a match for each other
You have the majority of your relevant masters studies behind you, and will be ready to dedicate yourself full-time to your task as well as finishing the corresponding thesis.
You have already done some data analytics or implemented a data-driven program. We want to see what you have created!
You really want to learn more about machine learning and programming and one day become a world-class professional in this.
You are fluent in English
Show us your work - Gather your most awesome study/hobby projects, then add a transcript of your studies. Spice these up with a short letter telling about who you are, and how you are going to grow into a real data scientist, which case you would like to work on, and send these to us.
Don’t forget to mention your student organisation or guild background - we like community-oriented people. For more inspiration, we have created an article about how to write great job applications.
For any questions, don't hesitate to contact Miikka Laitila. He's available for phone calls on the 23rd of March 13:00-16:00.

Haluatko olla luomassa unohtumattomia asiakaskokemuksia? Onko intohimonasi tuoteomistaminen ja haluatko johtaa yhtä Suomen suurimman asiakaspalautealustan kehitystä? Tule K-ryhmään ja kirjoita oma kappaleesi eurooppalaisen kaupan alan menestystarinaan.

K-ryhmä etsii energiseen ja uudistuvaan joukkoonsa tuoteomistajaa vastaamaan asiakaspalautealustan ”Hymyn” kehityksestä. Tehtävässäsi toimit monialaisessa tiimissä, jossa designer, ohjelmistokehittäjät, palautteen asiantuntijat ja analyytikot yhdessä tuovat asiakkaiden äänen mahdollisimman tiiviiksi osaksi liiketoiminnan kehitystä. Olet kiinnostunut palautteen antamisen prosessista ja teet paljon töitä sen eteen, että palautteen antaminen olisi mahdollisimman vaivatonta. Kunnioitat asiakkaiden yksityisyyttä ja pidät huolen, että kaikissa prosessin vaiheissa tietosuoja ja -turva on otettu huomioon. Et myöskään unohda henkilöitä, jotka vastaavat palautteeseen, vaan kehität niitä ominaisuuksia, joilla palautteisiin vastaaminen on mahdollisimman helppoa.

Ymmärrät, mitä metodeita ja työkaluja tuotteen elinkaari vaatii. Sinulla on kokemusta vaikuttavien tuotteiden kehittämisestä ja osaat muun muassa mitata tuotteen onnistumista kvantitatiivisin ja kvalitatiivisin menetelmin. Osaat priorisoida eri kehitysideat niin, että mahdollisimman pieni työ tuottaa mahdollisimman paljon arvoa käyttäjille ja K-ryhmän liiketoiminnoille. Et pelkää tehdä päätöksiä datan pohjalta ja osaat kommunikoida päätöksesi eri sidosryhmille, vaikka se saattaisi tuottaa välillä pettymyksiä.

Ymmärrät teksti- tai äänimuotoisen tiedon louhintaa ja oma-aloitteisesti tuot esiin ideoita, joilla palautteista kertyvää tietoa voitaisiin hyödyntää paremmin K-ryhmän liiketoiminnoissa. Sinulla on hyvä tekninen osaaminen – tiedät, mitä pilvipohjaisen tuotteen ja mikropalveluihin nojaavan arkkitehtuurin kehitys vaatii, ja tunnistat riippuvuudet eri järjestelmien välillä. Osaat mahdollisesti perusteet datan hallinnan ohjelmistokielistä kuten Pythonista tai R:stä ja lisäksi osaat tehdä tietokantakyselyjä hyödyntäen SQL:ää.

Olet erinomainen tiimipelaaja ja sinulle ei ole ongelma mukautua eri rooleihin: osaat olla tulkki mutta toisinaan, mikäli tilanne vaatii, olet tulipaloja sammuttava rauhallinen viestijä. Vaikka vastaat erityisesti asiakaspalautealustan teknisestä kehityksestä, tulet osallistumaan myös muiden kehitysosa-alueiden edistämiseen. Et karta vastuuta vaan oma-aloitteisesti käärit hihat ja viet eteenpäin asiakasdatan hallintaan ja datapohjaisiin palveluihin liittyviä tehtäviä.

Olet tyyppinä reilu, ja edistät avointa ja mukaan ottavaa työkulttuuria. Motivoit ympärilläsi olevia ihmisiä kehittymään asiakastiedon hallinnan ja tuoteomistamisen ammattilaisina.

Odotamme sinulta:
Kokemusta ketterästä tuotejohtamisesta: sinulla on näyttöä vaikuttavien tuotteiden kehittämisestä ja julkaisusta, osaat validoida eri kehitysominaisuuksien arvoa, osaat pilkkoa kehitysominaisuuksia pienemmiksi osiksi ja tunnet metodit, joilla kehitystä priorisoidaan
- Kokemusta web-palvelun onnistumisen mittaamisesta: sinulla on kokemusta a/b -testaamisesta, web-datan hyödyntämisestä ja olet lisäksi toteuttanut laadullista käyttäjätutkimusta
Kokemusta pilvipohjaisten palvelujen kehittämisestä: ymmärrät mikropalvelujen avulla toimivan arkkitehtuurin ja sen luomat riippuvuudet sekä hyödyt
Käytännön osaamista työkaluista ja teknologioista kuten Trello, Jira, Confluence, Postman, AWS, MS Azure
- Käytännön osaamista ohjelmointi- ja kyselykielistä kuten esimerkiksi C#, Python, R tai SQL
Kokemusta asiakasdatan hallinnasta: sinulla on ymmärrys yleisen tietosuoja-asetuksen periaatteista ja ymmärrät GDPR:n asettamat vaatimukset asiakasdatan hallinnalle
Ymmärrät tekstipohjaisen datan analysointia ja sitä, miten datatieteiden tekniikoita/tekoälyä voi hyödyntää tekstipohjaisen tiedon käsittelyssä. Sinulla on mahdollisesti kokemusta sanallisen palautteen analyysityökaluista.
Erinomaisia viestintätaitoja: osaat kääntää eri käyttäjien tarpeet teknisiksi vaatimuksiksi ja toisaalta, saat aikaan viestintämateriaalia, jolla kehitystarpeet ymmärretään yrityksen ylimmässä johdossa
Erinomaisia tiimitaitoja: et pelkää verkostossa toimimista, vaan osaat luovia useiden sidosryhmien välillä ja ottaa huomioon eri ihmisten tarpeet

Tarjoamme sinulle:
”Asiakastiedon hallinta ja datapalvelut” on verrattain uusi tiimi. Tiimin jäsenenä saat vaikuttaa laajoihin kokonaisuuksiin, ja pääset kehittämään tiimin työtä laajasti.
Asiakastiedon rooli on K-ryhmän strategian ytimessä, joten pääset johtamaan sellaisten tuotteiden kehitystä, joilla on strateginen rooli yrityksen toiminnassa.
Ympäristön, jossa suhtaudutaan intohimoisesti asiakasymmärrykseen ja asiakaskokemuksen kehittämiseen
Mahdollisuudet jatkuvaan itsensä kehittämiseen isossa organisaatiossa: saat ympärillesi ihmisiä, joilla on intoa oppia ja kehittyä kanssasi
Joustavan työn mahdollisuuden: saat olla autonominen ja kulttuurimme arvostaa työn ja vapaa-ajan tasapainoa
Työkulttuurin, joka arvostaa työn ja vapaa-ajan tasapainoa
Poikkeusolojen jälkeen voit tehdä töitä vastavalmistuneessa toimistossa, jonne on alle kymmenen minuutin metromatka Helsingin keskustasta

K-ryhmä on uudistuva, vahva ja vastuullinen toimija kahdeksassa maassa, ja meillä voit rakentaa uran eurooppalaisen kaupan huippuosaajien rinnalla. Tarjoamme sinulle joka päivä yhä mielenkiintoisempaa tekemistä sekä uusia näköaloja. Pidämme myös visusti huolta toisistamme, asiakkaista, yhteiskunnasta ja ympäristöstä.

Kaupan ala on jatkuvassa murroksessa ja tarjoaa siten mielenkiintoisen työympäristön sekä mahdollisuuden kehittää jokaisen yksilöllisiä vahvuuksia.

Lisätietoja tehtävästä antaa Hanna-Reetta Luukkainen, puh 040-7326248. Voit tiedustella lisätietoja 16.–18.3.2021 klo 16.30-18.
