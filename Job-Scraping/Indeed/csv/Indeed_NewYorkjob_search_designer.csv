You can contribute inclusive design practices and are comfortable in voicing your opinion.

You are obsessive about UX or UI design, you have an attention to detail regarding edge cases, hierarchy, contrast, cognition, etc...

You deliver designs with a systematic approach.

You think about interfaces not as static pixels but as dynamic experiences and can express yourself effortlessly with motion, flows and stories.

OUR VALUES
We're in this together: We have an audacious mission, and we're building a lot of things for the first time — from the first DTC pharma business within the healthcare ecosystem to the data infrastructure for providing real-world evidence in the largest category of chronic disease. It takes superpowers to build something simple and intuitive within the complex healthcare market, so we identify and work as a team from our individual points of strength. Not everyone has to be good at everything, but we know that when we harness what we're each great at, we're unstoppable.
Small wins create big wins: We ground every experience in optimism, recognizing and celebrating successes along the way. We break projects down into smaller components. And we focus on where we have momentum. We always plan for larger goals with the knowledge that our plans will evolve as we achieve smaller milestones.
You're in control: While we're headquartered in New York, we don't let location stand in the way of the best talent — and from coaches to engineers, many of us are fully remote. Our business is multi-faceted, so each Calibrater is hired to be an expert in their piece of it — in control of their own initiatives, in control of their own impact, and in control of driving their own (real) results.
Real results matter: We're obsessed with outcomes because when our members win, we win, and the data proves that we've built the best metabolic health program on the market. We're purposeful, optimistic, and relentlessly confident that we can solve the biggest medical issue of the 21st century.",https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=d621a7a66c48f4bf

We are the design ninjas breathing creative love into our brands, from the inside out.

We are responsible for all aspects of the development of design language that encompasses a brand's creative essence and visual equities, all part of the brand world. We craft design principles, design architecture and portfolio schematics, equity systems, packaging design, experiences, retail elements, and so on. We work in seamless integration with the Storytelling and Campaign Creative pillars, often partnering with a select network of design agencies and creatives that expand our team's creative footprint. Finally, we break our moulds from time to time, working in flexible team configurations to cross-pollinate our creative juices and deliver the most outstanding, brag-worthy and jaw-dropping design creative that screams strategy, makes hearts race, and builds our brands for a long love story with our consumers.
About you
You are a seasoned creative warrior, a broad idea thinker, a Design-Is-Brand's-Secret-Power. You've designed brands, ideas, experiences; you know that not one single touchpoint builds an entire brand love story with consumers. You are a blend of strategic badassery, hands-on mastery of the design craft and a good dose of bravery. As a Sr Designer - Creative Design Lead, you are the most senior creative reporting to the Sr Design Manager, part of a broader high-level design family dedicated to other brands and divisions of Danone North America. As such, you know how to imagine new concepts, construct the elements of compelling visual storytelling - and you go beyond that, often offering the initial heavy-hitting push to get the creative idea the boost it needs.

Success in this position looks like:
You have a sharp, strategic mind that quickly marries up design logic & creative talent.
You work collaboratively alongside other creative disciplines such as Storytelling, Consumer Engagement, Content Creation and beyond.
You shape creative approaches to solve problems while the Sr Design Manager crafts the strategy behind the creative, embracing the push-and-pull of this relationship.
You mentor & guide the creative development of the members of the creative team you are part of.
You dive in and challenge all the things our brands could be, giving them the creative love they deserve.
You have a deep and extensive understanding of design systems, design architecture, schematics scenarios and can work in sketch & low-fidelity format before rolling your thought into fully designed ideas.
You know how to transform brand strategy into creative work that has a positive impact.
You work well in a fast-paced setting under tight deadlines with strong project and time management skills, practicing patience when plans shift.
You find your happy place in highly conceptual loose-end projects. You also find freedom in the constraints of a tight brief.

In your day-to-day, you will:
Bring your design A-game to the table, creating designs that are thoughtful, intentional, grounded in solid rationale.
Take the work from brief evaluation and interrogation, developing design territories, pushing to find big ideas based on design strategy and the brief.
Develop strategic territories and ranges of original concepts for brand visual stories, packaging, print, demonstrating potential idea ramifications through brush strokes on what could be campaigns, digital, social, video and other touchpoints.
Create packaging design that is an object of desire, connecting it to the entire 360° brand experience through the brand world ecosystem.
Articulate and present original creative ideas and bring your creative work to life internally, during critiques, or externally to our brand and marketing partners, in partnership with the Sr Design Manager.
