Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.About The TeamDesigning a global ecosystem for knowledge sharing, and the platform for businesses to reach our audience, requires a multidisciplinary approach. To deliver our mission, we are designing systems that make knowledge sharing rewarding and discovery easy, while scaling to support the participation of the entire planet. We're building a diverse team with people of different backgrounds and experiences, empowered to shape strategy.Our designers leverage what they learn about psychological and social dynamics, communities and networks, and systems and policy design, in addition to more typical design skills.

Working on everything from ranking to UI, from internationalization to moderation systems, design decisions are validated through A/B testing and user studies alike, as we value rigor and empathy in equal measure. We pursue candor, holism, and awareness in our work.About The RoleQuora designers are strategic minded generalists who code. As a technical product designer, you'll be responsible for what you design from start to finish because designers at Quora control the interface — they have a central role on every product team.

Product design plays a significant role in product strategy and direction - our VP of Design reports directly to our CEO. As an integral part of that structure, you will be embedded in a product team focused on a major, user-facing area of Quora.We value rigor and empathy in equal measure, both are essential to democratize access to knowledge. Designers reason through complex product decisions, developing an opinion about the right solution in a given context.
